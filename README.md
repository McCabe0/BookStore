# Book Store - Gamesy Tech Test

## Brief

Create a software application that will give the price of a list of books. Taking into account discounts.

## My soultion 

The soultion that I have developed is a simple one, It allows the user of the application to add the book they want to their basket. Once the user goes to checkout it will give them the total price of the list of books in the basket, taking into account any discount that the books may have. 

## Future upgrades

if given more time, implement reading in the books from a database using Spring, or use the apache poi to read from an excel sheet.
